> Nuxt.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

A hook has been added to git so that the static content is always generated on commit and placed in the "docs" folder.  This makes the site easy to host on GitHub from that folder as the root of the site.

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
